# hello-world

Hello, how's it going everyone?

Tinkerman here.  I like to figure out how things work, and do so using my personal method.  It goes something like this:

1. Get curious about something (Web page, blackbox systems, APIs, microcontrollers...)
2. Think of every possible input or action
3. Guess at the expected behavior
4. Do the input or action
5. Make a note of the outcome
[Repeat]

When I get the curiosity bug real bad, I have a habit of rapidly figuring out how a thing works.  Unfortunately, this can come at the expense of clear documentation (and sleep), but it's something I'm working on by practicing my writing.  I often get to the end of understanding something, remember all the steps to get there, but can't easily answer specific questions about the journey.

Fortunately, I practice Kaizen, and started a [blog](https://medium.com/@tinkerman) to eradicate my weakness by writing down my discoveries.

See you around!

P.S. One of the first things I'm writing down is: ALWAYS end a file with a blank newline.  (I'll have to write a post to explain this!)
